# gatsby-starter-headless-wordpress

With this Gatsby.js starter template, you can get up and running quickly and easily with a Gatsby site that pulls database from a WordPress site that you have control over.

## For your WordPress site:
- [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) **Required**
- [WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.wpgraphql.com/acf/) *Optional*

## Deployment
I have included support for automatic GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions (currently in beta)
See `.github/workflows/push.yml` for the Actions workflow. Feel free to delete this file if you will be hosting elsewhere.
